# Set-Up
## Installation
To set up the environment, there are three things that you need to download,
 - **Git** (https://git-scm.com/)
 - **Git LFS** (https://git-lfs.com/)
 -  **GitHub Desktop** (https://desktop.github.com/). 

The order of installation of the Github Desktop does not matter, but you will need to Git before Git LFS. Using the default set-up config (especially the directory) for Git and Git LFS is recommended.

## Project Set-up
Open GitHub Desktop, go to File -> Clone Repository (Ctrl + Shift + O).

For the test project, choose the "URL" tab and enter the URL. But, once the Repo owner add you as a contributor, you should be able to find the Repo under the "GitHub.com" tab. 

Hit "Clone", and wait for the download to finish.
