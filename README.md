# Set-Up
## Installation
To set up the enviorment, there are three things that you need to download,
 - **Git** (https://git-scm.com/)
 - **Git LFS** (https://git-lfs.com/)
 -  **GitHub Desktop** (https://desktop.github.com/). 

The order of installation of the Github Desktop does not matter, but you will need to Git before Git LFS. Using the default set-up config (especially the directory) for Git and Git LFS is recogmended.

## Project Set-up
1. Open Github Desktop, go to File -> Clone Repository (Ctrl + Shift + O).

2. For the test project, choose the **"URL"** tab and enter the URL. But, once the Repo owner add you as a contributer, you should be able to find the Repo under the "GitHub.com" tab. 

3. Hit **"Clone"**, and wait for the download to finish.

4. After download, since Git LFS is already installed, it should already be working. If the Github Desktop client prompts you something along the lines of "This project is using LFS, do you want to use it?", just say yes.
